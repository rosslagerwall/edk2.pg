Don't initialize anything other than the BSP

For unknown reasons, after 7fadaacd50d7 "UefiCpuPkg/CpuDxe: Consume
MpInitLib to produce CPU MP Protocol services" Windows 10 hangs early in
boot (in HaliHaltSystem()) when booting with > 1 vCPU on Xen.  Work
around this by not bringing up any processors other than the BSP.
